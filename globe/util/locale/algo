locating the user via gmaps

the user moves maps from the original point

on center change:
	check the city
	compare the city against the one loaded from ?filter=

if city different:
	if result is actually a county within a city, do a lookup


on lookup
	compare county against every list in countries.json until found


open country data for England:
	compare each entry in csv file for the one entered from user

if match:
	lookup county for city
	return city
	load new city's posts


it might be easier to load all posts in that country and display them to the user that way, just start in the city they asked for. Check performance.


The for loop
=================================
for county in country:
	if county.csv file == desiredCounty:
		return county
	else:
		keep looking



Open the file
==================================
with_open as file etc:
	country = file.column(xyz)
	return country



Grab the results
==================================
posts = Post.query.filter_by("location=country").all(;
return posts

done
